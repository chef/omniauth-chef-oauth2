# Contributing to omniauth-chef-oauth2

We are glad you want to contribute to Chef! The first step is the desire to improve the project.  You can find the answers to additional frequently asked questions [on the wiki](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/How+to+Contribute).

## Contributing

  * Create an account on our [bug tracker](http://tickets.opscode.com).
  * Sign our contributor agreement (CLA) [online](https://secure.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=PJIF5694K6L). (Keep reading if you're contributing on behalf of your employer.)
  * Create a ticket for your change on the [bug tracker](http://tickets.opscode.com).
  * Link to your patch as a rebased git branch or pull request from the ticket.
  * Resolve the ticket as fixed.

We regularly review contributions and will get back to you if we have any suggestions or concerns.

## The Apache License and the CLA/CCLA

Licensing is very important to open source projects, it helps ensure the software continues to be available under the terms that the author desired.
Chef uses the Apache 2.0 license to strike a balance between open contribution and allowing you to use the software however you would like to.

The license tells you what rights you have that are provided by the copyright holder. It is important that the contributor fully understands what rights
they are licensing and agrees to them. Sometimes the copyright holder isn't the contributor, most often when the contributor is doing work for a company.

To make a good faith effort to ensure these criteria are met, Opscode requires a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or a Corporate Contributor License
Agreement (CCLA) for all contributions. This is without exception due to some matters not being related to copyright and to avoid having to continually
check with our lawyers about small patches.

It only takes a few minutes to complete a CLA, and you retain the copyright to your contribution.

You can complete our contributor agreement (CLA) [
online](https://secure.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=PJIF5694K6L).  If you're contributing on behalf of your employer, have
your employer fill out our [Corporate CLA](https://secure.echosign.com/public/hostedForm?formid=PIE6C7AX856) instead.
